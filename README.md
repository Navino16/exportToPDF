# exportToPDF
A script to export Google spreadsheet in PDF or only few specific sheets

I wrote this script follows a real lack when exporting to spreadsheets with Google. This script allows you to export to PDF.
The advantage of this over other already existing scripts ? It performs no copy of the file or leaves, used to export only selected sheets and above all it maintains the existing formulas when exporting !

To add it to a Google spreadsheet, open your spreadsheat and select the menu item **Tools > Script editor**. If you are presented with a welcome screen, click Blank Project. Delete any code in the script editor and paste in the content of each file in the folder **ExportToPDF_EN**. If you want respect my project architecture, you can create new script files in the project by select the menu **File > New > Script File**, enter the name as you want and click **OK**. Attention to the HTML file it is mandatory to create a new html file by select the menu **File > New > HTML File ** and paste HTML code into.

To use this add-on, select the menu item **ExportToPDF > Export To PDF**
When the window opens, enter the name of the PDF to generate (by default it is the name of the worksheet). Then select all the sheets to export (if you select "All", you do not need to check the other leaves) and then click "Export" (Please note, you must select at least one sheet).
After a few seconds you should see a window open showing where is the PDF and it's name.

If want to contribute to the project, you can make changes or corrections to the project and offer me. If they are accepted, you will be added to the file contributors.
It would initially turn this "bound script" in "standalone script" (to make it more easily installable) and why not improve desing HTML pages
