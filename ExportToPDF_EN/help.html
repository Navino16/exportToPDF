    <font size="2pt" face="arial">This add-on aims to simplify export spreadsheets to PDF. In fact, Google doesn't export more sheets in particular, but just one or all.</font><br><br>
    <font size="3pt" face="arial">To use this add-on, click the <b>"exportToPDF"</b> menu and then on <b>"Export to PDF"</b>.</font><br>
    <font size="3pt" face="arial">When the window opens, enter the name of the PDF to generate (by default it is the name of the document). Then select all the sheets to export (if you select "All", you do not need to check the other sheets) and then click <b>"Export"</b> (Please note, you must select at least one sheet).</font><br>
    <font size="3pt" face="arial">After a few seconds you should see a window open showing where is the PDF and it's name.</font>
